# Installation

To install, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the existence of the `.config` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it by running the following command:
    ```
    mkdir .config
    ```

2. Navigate to the `.config` directory:
    ```
    cd .config
    ```

3. Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:prabhatrastogik/nvim.git
    ```

This will clone the repository into the `.config` directory.
